## TPL O'Reilly (TPLO)

> Keeps you logged into your access to [O'Reilly Learning](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDMEDB0099&R=EDB0099) through Toronto Public Library

### Usage

This extension will log you back into your access to O'Reilly Learning once it detects that your session has expired.
(However, it may not always work due to [a Chromium bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1024211).)

Otherwise, you can click on the toolbar button of the extension to automatically log into O'Reilly Learning too.

### But why?
Your O'Reilly Learning session through TPL expires quite frequently. (At least for my own tastes.)
This extension may not be for you if you are fine with dealing with a minor hassle.

### Future Plans

- Extension listing on Web Stores
- Keep all your annotations, playlists, history, etc. persistent between sessions
- Support for non-TPL institutions using EZProxy
- Support for resources other than O'Reilly Learning
